# XeroToExcel-API-PracticeEnv
This repository is designed as a practice environment for developing and testing an API that integrates Xero, a popular accounting software, with Excel. The goal is to create a seamless interface that allows for the extraction, manipulation, and presentation of financial data from Xero directly into Excel spreadsheets.
